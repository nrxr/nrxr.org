      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m quite a workaholic and I know I have this bad habit. It tends to be bearable in normal circumstances but in the current pandemic situation is been so noticeable than in my dayjob I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked, repeatedly, to stop work.
I know, I&amp;rsquo;m lucky. My employer asks me to have healthy rutines. To keep a healthy personal life and stop my work, even though they are benefited in the short-term of my workaholicsm but they do understand the only outcome of this continuous habit is burnout and they want to avoid it.</description>
