I keep finding troubling mixed references to fascism and capitalism, as if they were the same when they are actually the opposite.
If you check PoliticalCompass.org you could see they match Hitler and fascism as a &amp;ldquo;centrist&amp;rdquo; because they graph left and right as economic models, left being planning (socialism) and right being free-market (capitalism).</description></item><item><title>Politics is visceral</title><link>https://nrxr.org/post/politics-is-visceral/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nrxr.org/post/politics-is-visceral/</guid><description>The Aeon magazine published a great essay called Politics is visceral where they explain how politics play with the anger and fear of people and how that translates into support for one or the another depending if the generate fear or anger.
The missing thing here is how in trying to exploit the generation of anger or fear on theirs they may be creating anger or fear in the other side and exarcebate the support for extremists and even more polarization on society.</description></item></channel></rss>
