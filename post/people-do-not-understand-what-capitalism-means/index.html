Was that investment determined by private decision? Was the distribution of that good (the bailouts) determined by competition in a free market?</p><p>No. It was decided by a central institution, by a state institution, by politicians. It&rsquo;s the contrary of what capitalism actually is because a central part of capitalism is having a free market.</p><p>The word you&rsquo;re looking for is <a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/corporatism>corporatism</a>.</p><p>Not socialism? Well, you see, the advantage here is that I&rsquo;m not a politician so I don&rsquo;t have to play to be visceral with what I&rsquo;m saying. I don&rsquo;t need to inject fear or anger in you. The world is not black or white. Corporatism is using the State to favor some professional and industrial groups being used as political representation.</p><p>So now you can read articles <a href=https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gz9m/dark-souls-is-a-game-about-living-under-capitalism-in-2020>like this from VICE</a> and not be fooled by blissful ignorance being spread with such confidence.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/capitalism>capitalism</a></li><li><a href=/tags/politics>politics</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/nrxr rel=me title=Github><i data-feather=github></i></a>
