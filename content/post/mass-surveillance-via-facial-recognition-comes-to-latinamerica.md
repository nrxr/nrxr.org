The Washinton Post reports on [Buenos Aires' govt using facial recognition on minors and violating their privacy rights](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/10/09/argentina-facial-recognition-juvenile-suspects/).

Main issues: inaccurate data in their database and inaccurate recognition in minors. There has been fights already in [the UK against the usage of facial recognition by the police](https://www.cnet.com/news/police-use-of-facial-recognition-gets-reined-in-by-uk-court/) and in [the US there's been controversies and calls for bans](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/why-we-should-ban-facial-recognition-technology.html).

Hopefully the same sentiment and approach is given in latinamerica where there's less transparency on the government's usage of data making the risk of misuse bigger and more threathening to individuals.
