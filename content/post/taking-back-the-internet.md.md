A few days back, I was speaking at a school to teenagers that want to get into the tech industry. During this talk, I got reminded about the idea I had for the Internet when I was their age.

Certainly, back there, my idea for the Internet was not an engagement-trap, a doom-scrolling source eternal distraction out of silly purpose-void content. My idea was more an infinite collection of useful information to improve humanity's knowledge.

I actually got into open source communities, and believed in the "information must be free" slogan. And still do.

I got reminded I'm a builder; I helped built the current Internet but is in our hands, still, the ability to build the future of the Internet.

To my fellow Internet builders: is our turn to take it back and build what we wanted. The tools are every-day cheaper and it's becoming increasinly easier to build what we want and need.
