I started to think a lot how I consider code-style very important and a form of art when done correctly.
Styling goes around organizing, writing correctly, naming correctly, documenting correctly.

One of the very interesting things of using a compiled programming language like Go is that you end up with tiny binaries, which then you can distribute as such. If combined with Docker you can end up with very tiny images that are faster and cheaper to distribute.</description></item></channel></rss>
