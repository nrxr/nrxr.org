It tends to be bearable in normal circumstances but in the current pandemic situation is been so noticeable than in my dayjob I&rsquo;ve been asked, repeatedly, to stop work.</p><p>I know, I&rsquo;m lucky. My employer asks me to have healthy rutines. To keep a healthy personal life and stop my work, even though they are benefited in the short-term of my workaholicsm but they do understand the only outcome of this continuous habit is burnout and they want to avoid it.</p><p>Given this has been the case, I decided I was going to break the cycle and take actions to stop the workaholic train. Yet, my context makes things that others have tried a little more hard. People tend to have different locations in their home for work, so they can &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo;, yet I have only one place available at home to work and play and live. I love being at a computer, my work is computers, my hobby is computers, so is kinda hard to stop working.</p><p>I started by having separate computers, separate keyboards, separate screens, separate apps. I even changed themes on my code-editors so I can &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>IT WORKED</strong>. Weird, right? But thanks to this my brain basically disconnects from work and surprisely I&rsquo;m even writing in my personal blog again.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re like me, then try it. Anything that hints your brain &ldquo;work-time ended&rdquo; will help.</p><p>Hope you can break the cycle as well.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/life>life</a></li><li><a href=/tags/work>work</a></li><li><a href=/tags/balance>balance</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/nrxr rel=me title=Github><i data-feather=github></i></a>
