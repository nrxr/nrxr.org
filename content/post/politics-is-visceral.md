The Aeon magazine published a great essay called [Politics is visceral](https://aeon.co/essays/politics-is-in-peril-if-it-ignores-how-humans-regulate-the-body) where they explain how politics play with the anger and fear of people and how that translates into support for one or the another depending if the generate fear or anger.

The missing thing here is how in trying to exploit the generation of anger or fear on theirs they may be creating anger or fear in the other side and exarcebate the support for extremists and even more polarization on society.

Is a good read and I suggest everyone to take some time to inform themselves on it. It has an option to listen to the essay as well.
